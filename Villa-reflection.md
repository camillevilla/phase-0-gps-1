- What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had the least amount of experience with merge conflicts.

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Merge conflicts.

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We had questions about how code blocks are used in Markdown documents.

- What still confuses you about Git?
I just want to get more experience merging branches that two different people have been working on simultaneously.

- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a little awkward, but I was glad to have the guide there. He was able to help clarify some of the more advanced concepts and offer some insight into best practices.
